# Faint Frontiers Open Source Edition
This is the open source version of the game.

Play the released prototype v0.4 with the newest assets of the game here: https://skydrifter.itch.io/faint-frointiers-v04

The zip file has the complete godot project excluding the sprites and worlds as in the released prototype. It was lastly tested and can be run with Godot Version 3.3. Here you will find assets that were used at the primary development stages of the game. 

In the folders of this repository you will find the scenes with code of the player and enemies, as they have the most complex mechanics and behavior in this game (as for now). For the next releases, we will be mostly concetrating on improving these and adding more new characters. Feel free to fork it. We are happy for suggestions, bug reports and any contribution!
