# Faint Frontiers: Developer Edition
This is an experimental and cutting-edge release of the game.


The repository has the complete godot project excluding the sprites and worlds as in the released prototype. The assets used here were made specially for this version.
 
For the next releases, we will be mostly concetrating on improving these and adding more new characters. Feel free to fork it. We are happy for suggestions, bug reports and any contribution!

A guide on design process of the game comming soon!
