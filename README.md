# Faint Frontiers Open Source Edition
This is the open source version of the game.

Play the released prototype with the newest assets of the game here: https://skydrifter.itch.io/faint-frontiers

The repository has the complete godot project excluding the sprites and worlds as in the released prototype. The assets used here were made specially for this version.
 
For the next releases, we will be mostly concetrating on improving these and adding more new characters. Feel free to fork it. We are happy for suggestions, bug reports and any contribution!

A guide on design process of the game comming soon!
